Use the following API ```GET http://www.cheapshark.com/api/1.0/deals```  which returns a list of Deal items that look like this:

```
{
    internalName: "THEWITCHER2ASSASSINSOFKINGSENHANCEDEDITION",
    title: "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition",
    metacriticLink: "/game/pc/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings",

    storeID: "8",
    gameID: "5572",
    salePrice: "2.99",
    normalPrice: "19.99",

    metacriticScore: "88",
    releaseDate: 1305590400,
    lastChange: 1445532509,
    dealRating: "9.6"
}
```

Create a page that displays the returned information using the following criteria:

 * Deals must be grouped by a generated ```score``` property
     - The ```score``` property must be derived from the ```metacriticScore``` property which has a score range of 0-100
     - The ```score``` property must be rounded to the next greatest tens (96 -> 100)

 * The score groups must be listed in numerically descending order

 * Deals must be listed with their associated group
    - Deals must be listed by their ```title``` property and ```score``` property
    - Deals must be listed in alphabetically ascending order by ```title``` within their group

 * The solution must be written entirely in javascript that is runnable by chrome (html/css are allowed of course)
 * You must also use ```Angular``` to generate your views and fetch your data
